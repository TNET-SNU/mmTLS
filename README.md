# mmTLS
mmTLS is a highly scalable TLS middlebox for monitoring encrypted traffic.

Because Bluefield-2 SmartNIC is required for reproducing, we highly recommend you to run test scripts in our remote machines.
If you want to build and run on your own, please refer to INSTALL.md.
This page assumes that you have an access to our machine, box1.kaist.ac.kr via ssh.
Go to kvpn.kaist.ac.kr, and follow the instruction. You can log in to Ivanti VPN using a temporary account, cerotyki.

After applying kvpn, run below on your local machine to log in.
```Bash
ssh guest@box1.kaist.ac.kr
```
You should be able to see your home.
