# mmTLS

mmTLS is a highly scalable TLS middlebox for monitoring encrypted traffic.

<img style="width:800px;" src="https://github.com/TNET-SNU/mmTLS/assets/53930924/08e02f36-be13-443a-b923-3278b487c80f" />

mmTLS  achieves high throughput and low latency leveraging the techniques below.

1. Single connection architecture which removes redundant TLS/TCP handshakes, flow management, memory copies, and re-encryption
2. Scalable key distribution via SmartNIC (or a dedicated CPU core)
3. Minimal overhead on private tag generation/verification
4. Support for event-driven API for programming TLS connections



# Accessing machines remotely for AE

mmTLS currently leverages the Bluefield-2 SmartNIC, so we recommend accessing our test machine with the SmartNIC from remotely and running test scripts on them.
If you want to build and run the system on your own, please refer to INSTALL.md.
We have set up a simple testbed to evaluate the functionality of our work, used for ATCâ€™24 artifact evaluation.
Please let us know (cerotyki@gmail.com or HotCRP) and we will provide the credential to login to the test machine.
Our testbed consists of 7 machines: 4 clients, 1 middlebox, and 2 backend servers (see the picture below) and all of them are accessible by ssh.
Please log into the access server (i.e., box3.kaist.ac.kr) first, and you can log into other machines from it.
The figure below depicts the topology of our testbed.

<img style="width:800px;" src="https://github.com/TNET-SNU/mmTLS/assets/53930924/7b82e7f2-834f-474c-9cad-c8b43e8ee3f1" />

This page assumes that you have access to box3.kaist.ac.kr via ssh.

```Bash
# on your local
ssh atc-ae@box3.kaist.ac.kr -p [port]
```

Now you can log into the middlebox machine (box1.kaist.ac.kr) which has the AE scripts for figure 8, 9, 10, 13, 14, and 16.

```Bash
# on box3.kaist.ac.kr
ssh junghan@box1.kaist.ac.kr
```

Or, you can log into the client machine (wood1.kaist.ac.kr) which has the AE scripts for figure 11, 12, and 17.

```Bash
# on box3.kaist.ac.kr
ssh junghan@wood1.kaist.ac.kr
```

For figure 15, which requires compiled chromium, you should log into box2.kaist.ac.kr with -X option to use X window.

```Bash
# on your local
ssh -X atc-ae@box3.kaist.ac.kr -p [port]
```

```Bash
# on box3.kaist.ac.kr
ssh -X junghan@box2.kaist.ac.kr
```



# Figure 8 - Persistent Connection Test

<img style="width:800px;" src="https://github.com/TNET-SNU/mmTLS/assets/53930924/0ca8fc65-0562-465e-ac7c-f5c19882dc58" />

We have prepared a automated script to generate results for figure 8.
Log in to box1.kaist.ac.kr first.

```Bash
# on atc-ae@box3.kaist.ac.kr
ssh junghan@box1.kaist.ac.kr
```

Then, run the script, 'run-persistent.sh'

```Bash
# on box1.kaist.ac.kr
cd ~/mmTLS/proxies/mOS/mmTLS
./run-persistent.sh
```

It will take about **25 minutes.**
The script will print the throughput of mmTLS (1), mmTLS (2), splitTLS (1), splitTLS (2), and mcTLS (2) as below.

<img style="width:800px;" src="https://github.com/TNET-SNU/mmTLS/assets/53930924/1b3a9327-c972-438a-9243-bd70f2885b26" />



# Figure 9 - Ephemeral Connection Test

<img style="width:800px;" src="https://github.com/TNET-SNU/mmTLS/assets/53930924/8a8e8669-d295-4a11-ab8c-f2d6bc1a74dd" />


```diff
- For AE of Figure 9, we found that there was a mis-configuration at the last evaluation.
- The result of mmTLS that you reproduce in this section will be about 40K/s, but it is correct result.
- We will update the final result for the camera-ready version.
- Sorry for your inconvenience.
```

Login to the middlebox machine (box1.kaist.ac.kr).

```Bash
# on atc-ae@box3.kaist.ac.kr
ssh junghan@box1.kaist.ac.kr
```

Then, run the script, 'run-ephemeral.sh' as below.

```Bash
# on box1.kaist.ac.kr
cd ~/mmTLS/proxies/mOS/mmTLS
./run-ephemeral.sh
```
This script will take about **5 minutes** and print the throughput as below.

<img style="width:600px;" src="https://github.com/TNET-SNU/mmTLS/assets/53930924/ed67ad11-4847-430d-a050-ef2947eb31c5" />




# Figure 10 - Key Delay Measurement



# Figure 11 - Response Time - LAN

<img style="width:800px;" src="https://github.com/TNET-SNU/mmTLS/assets/53930924/8490913b-e9f3-4a3d-a99d-b5b59136eb1b" />

<img style="width:800px;" src="https://github.com/TNET-SNU/mmTLS/assets/53930924/867552f4-17bb-4ae3-95fd-f0ce04cefcc1" />

We measure the average of 100 LAN response times and 100 WAN response times.
To simplify your evaluation, we have prepared a simple all-in-one script on the client side.
Log into wood1.kaist.ac.kr first.

```Bash
# on atc-ae@box3.kaist.ac.kr
ssh junghan@wood1.kaist.ac.kr
```

Move to the fig11 directory and run 'all-in-one.sh' script. It takes about **6 minutes.**

```Bash
# on wood1.kaist.ac.kr
cd ~/fig11
./all-in-one.sh
```

<img style="width:800px;" src="https://github.com/TNET-SNU/mmTLS/assets/53930924/44983fe6-d176-435b-b540-621020a0c2ce" />

The result will be equivalent to figure 11 for both 11(a) -GCM- and 11(b) -CBC-.

```diff
- For AE of Figure 11 (a), we found that there were disk IO delays in E2E response time.
- On this evaluation, we removed the disk IO by warming up the web servers.
- For AE of Figure 11 (b), we found that the key exchange protocols were not consistent among mmTLS and the baselines.
- mmTLS and Split-TLS were using RSA for key exchange while mcTLS was using DHE with 1024-bit DH parameter.
- We make them use a common key exchange protocol, DHE with 2048-bit DH parameter, which is supported by mcTLS.
- We will update the final result for the camera-ready version.
- Sorry for your inconvenience.
```

<img style="width:800px;" src="https://github.com/TNET-SNU/mmTLS/assets/53930924/0a857799-c9bb-4baf-a151-13c7304f39a9" />

For figure 12, we have prepared a simple 'all-in-one.sh' script on the client side as well as fig 11.
Log into wood1.kaist.ac.kr first.

```Bash
# on atc-ae@box3.kaist.ac.kr
ssh junghan@wood1.kaist.ac.kr
```

Then, run below.

```
# on wood1.kaist.ac.kr
cd ~/fig12
./all-in-one.sh
```

It will take about **15 minutes,** and print the result as below.

<img style="width:800px;" src="https://github.com/TNET-SNU/mmTLS/assets/53930924/d763d77f-a50c-4094-b8e4-acb174dbd4aa" />

Note that this script modifies the default routing table entry to make the WAN traffic come and go via LAN (private network) interface instead of the default WAN (public network) interface.
(Unless, WAN traffic will not go to the middlebox which is connected via the LAN interface.)
If you are accessing via ssh to the WAN interface of the client (wood1), your ssh session will be lost.
Please do ssh from the access machine (box3), and run the script.
Since the news site is updated every hour, the result will be different with our evaluation.
We recommend you to check the gap between mmTLS and split-TLS, rather than the absolute response time of mmTLS.
Also, www.washingtonpost.com no longer supports http/1.1.
It currently accepts only http/2.
However, the nginx proxy (split-TLS) currently supports up to http/1.1 as a backend upstream connection, so we could not fully reproduce the result of split-TLS.
So, the result for washingtonpost will appear empty.
If you think the absolute response time is necessary, please let us know.
We will prepare other popular web sites to test split-TLS to WAN.



# Figure 13a - Scalability

<img style="width:400px;" src="https://github.com/TNET-SNU/mmTLS/assets/53930924/266cfaff-859c-48c0-a1ba-0a3b5b4da25b" />

Log into the middlebox machine, and just run the script, 'run-scalability.sh', which automatically tests mmTLS middlebox and nginx TLS proxy with various number of cores.

```Bash
# on atc-ae@box3.kaist.ac.kr
ssh junghan@box1.kaist.ac.kr
```

```Bash
# on box1.kaist.ac.kr
cd ~/mmTLS/proxies/mOS/mmTLS
./run-scalability.sh
```

The script will take about **7 minutes** and print the result as below.

<img style="width:600px;" src="https://github.com/TNET-SNU/mmTLS/assets/53930924/f5b5c638-9001-4a17-adf8-9d9afb211a42" />

Login to the middlebox machine (box1.kaist.ac.kr).

```Bash
# on atc-ae@box3.kaist.ac.kr
ssh junghan@box1.kaist.ac.kr
```

Run the script below.

```Bash
# on box1.kaist.ac.kr
cd ~/mmTLS/proxies/mOS/mmTLS
./run-compare-with-e2e.sh
```

It will take about **7 minutes** and finally print the throughput of mmTLS and E2E-TLS as below.

<img style="width:800px;" src="https://github.com/TNET-SNU/mmTLS/assets/53930924/aeaedb59-1974-4109-9d64-ed8ea14a1d20" />

Go to the openssl-modified directory on the mmTLS root directory, and run the 'tag' script.
It generates private tags in various methods for record size of 1KB, 2KB, 4KB, 8KB, and 16KB, then measures the relative overhead using average time spent.

```Bash
# on atc-ae@box3.kaist.ac.kr
ssh junghan@box1.kaist.ac.kr
```

```Bash
# on box1.kaist.ac.kr
cd mmTLS/proxies/mOS/mmTLS
./tag
```

It will take about **1 minute.**
Each column means Original (no private tag), mmTLS (optimal), Reusing ciphertext, and Double tags (naive), respectively.

## Default Chromium (for split-TLS and E2E-TLS)

This evaluation needs chromium GUI application and the extension program.
We manually measured the page load time shown by the chromium extension, so it is difficult to automatically reproduce the figure.
Here, we only provide how to run the test manually.

First log in to the client machine, box2.kaist.ac.kr with -X option to enable X window.
You should have been connected to the first access server (box3.kaist.ac.kr) with -X option before ssh into the client machine.

```Bash
# on your local
ssh -X atc-ae@box3.kaist.ac.kr
```

Then, log in to the machine that has pre-built chromium with -X option.

```Bash
# on atc-aebox3.kaist.ac.kr
ssh -X junghan@box2.kaist.ac.kr
```

Before testing, unset mmTLS configuration and go to the chromium directory.

```Bash
# on box2.kaist.ac.kr
sudo ~/unmmtls.sh
cd chromium/src/out
```

You can run the default chrome with some options as below.

```Bash
./Default/chrome --ignore-certificate-errors --disable-proxy-certificate-handler --test-type
```

If you want to test split-TLS, type https://10.11.95.1:21443/200.html on the URL space.
Else if you want to test E2E-TLS, type https://10.11.95.3:1443/200.html on the URL space as below.

<img style="width:1000px;" src="https://github.com/TNET-SNU/mmTLS/assets/53930924/726cd67d-5768-4dfb-b56a-02f7e31a4e48" />

It will load the page with a number of embedding resources.
After loading, click the first extension and check the total loading timing. (754ms in the screenshot)
You can repeat by typing **"Ctrl + F5". (No refresh button or "only F5", since they do not establish a new TLS connection.)**
Since it's a LAN connection, the result will be pretty stable, even though you do not repeat it 100 times fully to measure the average.

However, the absolute result will not be exactly same as the figure, since the chromium client machine is changed.
Again, we recommend you to check the gap between E2E-TLS/mmTLS and split-TLS in terms of the page load time.

If you want to change the number of embedding resources, change the name of requested html file to one among 10.html, 20.html, 50.html, 100.html, and 200.html
The number in the name of html file means the number of 136KB embedding resources.



## mmTLS-ported Chromium

To test the mmTLS-ported chromium, ssh into the client machine with '-X' option.

```Bash
# on your local
ssh -X atc-ae@box3.kaist.ac.kr -p [port]
```

```Bash
# on atc-ae@box3.kaist.ac.kr
ssh -X junghan@box2.kaist.ac.kr
```

Run the 'mmtls.sh' script to setup configuration for mmTLS and go to the chromium directory.

```Bash
# on box2.kaist.ac.kr
sudo ~/mmtls.sh
cd chromium/src/out
```

Then, run the mmTLS middlebox and the key-server on the middlebox machine (box1.kaist.ac.kr).
We provide a script that runs both automatically.

```Bash
# on the same directory on box2.kaist.ac.kr
./run-mmtls-middlebox.sh
```

Now, you can run mmTLS-ported chromium.

```Bash
./mmtls/chrome --ignore-certificate-errors --disable-proxy-certificate-handler --test-type
```

To test mmTLS, type https://10.11.95.3:1443/[number-of-embedding-resources].html on the URL apace.
The other steps are the same with the section above.

After testing, you should stop the mmtls middlebox.

```Bash
./stop-mmtls-middlebox.sh
```

<img style="width:800px;" src="https://github.com/TNET-SNU/mmTLS/assets/53930924/e83eee3c-58f2-4450-b8f9-446800c29a14" />

First, login to the middlebox machine (box1.kaist.ac.kr).

```Bash
# on atc-ae@box3.kaist.ac.kr
ssh junghan@box1.kaist.ac.kr
```

Then, run the script below.

```Bash
# on box1.kaist.ac.kr
cd mmTLS/proxies/mOS/mmTLS
./run-dpi.sh
```

It will take about **6 minutes**, and print the result as below.

<img style="width:600px;" src="https://github.com/TNET-SNU/mmTLS/assets/53930924/8a23a6ab-9701-4e3c-9f10-3f1a79cbc94c" />



# Figure 17 - Another Sample Application - Cipherstats

<img style="width:800px;" src="https://github.com/TNET-SNU/mmTLS/assets/53930924/fe423586-39d1-4f64-8ed3-86d01965fe7f" />

We provide an all-in-one script that runs the mmTLS middlebox application, 'my_cipherstat' on the middlebox machine (box1.kaist.ac.kr) and 'key-server' on the SmartNIC.
Login to the client machine (wood1.kaist.ac.kr).

```Bash
# on atc-ae@box3.kaist.ac.kr
ssh junghan@wood1.kaist.ac.kr
```

Then, go to the fig17 directory, and run 'all-in-one.sh' as below.

```Bash
# on box1.kaist.ac.kr
cd ~/fig17
./all-in-one.sh alexa-test
```

It will print whether the site is accessible from our testbed as below.

<img style="width:400px;" src="https://github.com/TNET-SNU/mmTLS/assets/53930924/5b94af03-2bac-4680-89e0-5b2a279ec0bd" />

It will take about **30 minutes.**
At the end of the script, it will stop the middlebox and print the summarized result by reading it from the middlebox machine (box1.kaist.ac.kr).

<img style="width:400px;" src="https://github.com/TNET-SNU/mmTLS/assets/53930924/56dfbad2-3593-4c4a-b5c1-2f1ed14f0531" />

The result which is equivalent to the figure 17.
Since the web sites on WAN are updated every hour, the result might not be exactly same as the figure.



# Configuring nginx a baseline middlebox (Split-TLS) and endpoints

The configuration of nginx as a Split-TLS middlebox is shown below.
If you want to test without the script we prepared, make h2load or ab on the client machines send requests to the responsible port.
Note that svr0 and svr1 refer to box3.kaist.ac.kr and box4.kaist.ac.kr, respectively.

```
	# LAN

	# endpoint:	0xxxx,	proxy to svr0: 	1xxxx,	proxy to svr1:	2xxxx
	# persistent: 	x0xxx, 	ephemeral: 	x1xxx,
	# TCP:		xx080, 	TLS12: 		xx442, 	TLS13:		xx443

	# 00080: endpoint persistent		TCP
	# 01080: endpoint ephemeral		TCP

	# 00442: endpoint persistent		TLS12
	# 01442: endpoint ephemeral		TLS12

	# 00443: endpoint persistent		TLS13
	# 01443: endpoint ephemeral		TLS13
	
	# 10080: proxy to svr0 persistent	TCP 
	# 11080: proxy to svr0 ephemeral	TCP

	# 10442: proxy to svr0 persistent	TLS12
	# 11442: proxy to svr0 ephemeral	TLS12

	# 10443: proxy to svr0 persistent	TLS13
	# 11443: proxy to svr0 ephemeral	TLS13

	# 20080: proxy to svr1 persistent	TCP
	# 21080: proxy to svr1 ephemeral	TCP

	# 20442: proxy to svr1 persistent	TLS12
	# 21442: proxy to svr1 ephemeral	TLS12

	# 20443: proxy to svr1 persistent	TLS13
	# 21443: proxy to svr1 ephemeral	TLS13


	# WAN

	# proxy to WAN:		3xxxx

	# 30443: proxy to usatoday		ephemeral	TLS13
	# 31443: proxy to bbc			ephemeral	TLS13
	# 32443: proxy to nytimes		ephemeral	TLS13
	# 33443: proxy to cnn			ephemeral	TLS13
	# 34443: proxy to washingtonpost	ephemeral	TLS13
```

The configuration of nginx as endpoints is a subset of above. Endpoints (box3, box4) use only upper 6 ports; 80, 1080, 442, 1442, 443, 1443.
You don't need to modify the configuration files. It's just for reference.
